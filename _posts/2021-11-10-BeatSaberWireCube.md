## The Problem:
Normal bloq (cube) causes visual overload in high note-density songs. 
Arrow on default bloq is highly stylised, and therefore less readable.

## Proposed Solution:
Solution Requirements:
Blocks take up less screen space and/or is less distracting.
The directional arrow becomes more clear.

Action Items:
Create a replacement .bloq usesable with the <Custom Notes> mod for PC.
Create a .qbloq version for <Qosmetics> mod for Occulus Quest.

## Final Solution:
Mod uses existing Custom Notes mod for BeatSaber on PC.
Mod functions with in-game custom colours.
Mod includes built-in extra large arrow
NOTE: does not work with some ingame modifiers, such as "ghost notes".
