## The Problem:
<ul><li>Normal bloq (cube) causes visual overload in high note-density songs.</li>
<li>Arrow on default bloq is highly stylised, and therefore less readable.</li></ul>

## Proposed Solution:
Solution Requirements:
<ul><li>Blocks take up less screen space and/or is less distracting.</li>
<li>The directional arrow becomes more clear.</li></ul>

Action Items:
<ul><li>Create a replacement .bloq usesable with the <Custom Notes> mod for PC.</li>
  <li>Create a .qbloq version for <Qosmetics> mod for Occulus Quest.</li></ul>

## Final Solution:
<ul><li>Mod uses existing Custom Notes mod for BeatSaber on PC.</li>
<li>Mod functions with in-game custom colours.</li>
<li>Mod includes built-in extra large arrow</li>
<li>NOTE: does not work with some ingame modifiers, such as "ghost notes".</li></ul>
